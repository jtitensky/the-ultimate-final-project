5-16 H: implement evaluate function and now "basic" property works :)\
5-22 J: made the input thingy for basic and wrote definite integral and derivative functions
5-23 H: created input for graph, created graph funtion for normal y= functions (major bug/problem with properly getting input - screwey and unusable input at times when operations are used), implemented the very basics for graphing
5-23 J: fixed a small thing in evaluate, and also made it work for e, pi, (arc)sin, (arc)cos, (arc)tan, log, ln, and abs
5-24 J: fixed stuff in evaluate for hopefully the last time
5-25 J: made differentiate be for nth derivatives, and started matrix functions
5-26 J: fixed graph input problem and did more matrix functions
5-28 J: made small numbers not break evaluate when their in scientific notation
5-29 J: did statistics functions, for 1 and 2 variables
