Project Name / Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amateur Graphing-Calculator that contains these features:
- evaluating an expression
- finding definite integrals + value of function @ some derivative
- graphing x-y function, polars, and parametrics
- basic matrix operations (multiplication, addition, finding transpose, finding discriminant)
- simple two variable statistics (mean, mode, regression, etc.)

Development Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5-15 H: created Calculator and menu-like thing
5-15 J: wrote evaluate function (for infix notation, handles (),!,%,^,*,/,+,-)
5-16 H: implement evaluate function and now "basic" property works :)\
5-22 J: made the input thingy for basic and wrote definite integral and derivative functions
5-23 H: created input for graph, created graph funtion for normal y= functions (major bug/problem with properly getting input - screwey and unusable input at times when operations are used), implemented the very basics for graphing
5-23 J: fixed a small thing in evaluate, and also made it work for e, pi, (arc)sin, (arc)cos, (arc)tan, log, ln, and abs (the input for any of these functions has to be in ())
5-24 J: fixed stuff in evaluate for hopefully the last time
5-25 J: made differentiate be for nth derivatives, and started matrix functions
5-25 H: fully implemented regualr x-y function graphing + giving option of adjusting axis + steps
5-26 J: fixed graph input problem and did more matrix functions
5-28 J: made small numbers not break evaluate when their in scientific notation
5-28 H: worked on graphing screen and made polar stuff
5-29 J: did statistics functions, for 1 and 2 variables
6-01 H: expanded graph to parametrics
6-01 J: changed the basic screen to expand textbox and not limit # of characters
6-02 H: merged basic + calc screen + created option for using ans in expression
6-04 H: worked on matrices screen/user input for matrices...
6-05 J: made the input screen for statistics
6-06 H: updates calculator screen to be final and have description of features
6-06 J: made option to switch between radians and degrees in basic and finished the input screen for stats

Project Plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~
- hierarchy of needs for this to be worthy of being called project:
   - being to properly take and parse through user input
   - evaluate expression properly (getting that function down)
   - using processing to graph various relationships / getting the drawing to work properly
