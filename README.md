Project Name / Description
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Amateur Graphing-Calculator that contains these features:
- evaluating an expression
- finding definite integrals + value of function @ some derivative
- graphing x-y function, polars, and parametrics
- basic matrix operations (multiplication, addition, finding transpose, finding discriminant)
- simple two variable statistics (mean, mode, regression, etc.)

Development Log
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
5-15 H: created Calculator and menu-like thing
5-15 J: wrote evaluate function (for infix notation, handles (),!,%,*,/,+,-)
5-16 H: implement evaluate function and now "basic" property works :)\
5-22 J: made the input thingy for basic and wrote definite integral and derivative functions
5-23 H: created input for graph, created graph funtion for normal y= functions (major bug/problem with properly getting input - screwey and unusable input at times when operations are used), implemented the very basics for graphing
5-23 J: fixed a small thing in evaluate, and also made it work for e, pi, (arc)sin, (arc)cos, (arc)tan, log, ln, and abs
5-24 J: fixed stuff in evaluate for hopefully the last time
5-25 J: made differentiate be for nth derivatives, and started matrix functions
5-25 H: fully implemented regualr x-y function graphing + giving option of adjusting axis + steps
5-26 J: fixed graph input problem and did more matrix functions
5-28 J: made small numbers not break evaluate when their in scientific notation
5-28 H: worked on graphing screen and made polar stuff
5-29 J: did statistics functions, for 1 and 2 variables
6-01 H: expanded graph to parametrics
6-01 J: changed the basic screen to expand textbox and not limit # of characters
6-02 H: merged basic + calc screen + created option for using ans in expression
6-04 H: worked on matrices screen/user input for matrices...
6-05 J: made the input screen for statistics
6-06 H: updates calculator screen to be final and have description of features
